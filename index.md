## GoDaddy and Me

I have been using GoDaddy to register domain names for years. They are the first registrar I ever used and I am sure that I came to them because of television commercials. Over the last few years, I have been slowly migrating my domains out of GoDaddy for reasons of personal taste. I have thought for a long time that the web interface they have is designed all around up-selling, instead of good user experience. I liken it to mobile games with tons of in app purchases.

But you know what they do really well? Customer service. *That* is where they nail both user experience/satisfaction and still have clear sales goals. Which, by the way, does not make them evil. They are a company. They sell a service. That's how it works.

## April calling

Today, I got a call from a lovely lady named April informing me that this very domain was set to expire. This was not news to me and I was ready to let this domain go because all it has done for years was redirect to [my acting website](http://dondentonactor.com). She and I got into a conversation about her acting aspirations and her recent appearance on Candid Camera.

I decided to renew this domain simply because she was pleasant and fun to talk to for a few minutes. She noticed that I was an actor and told me of her appearance on Candid Camera. [Check it out](http://www.tvland.com/episodes/zhmxkx/candid-camera-candid-camera-101-ep-101) at 34:22. Or... um... just watch below.

## What does this mean?

GoDaddy gets me for another year. Just thought I'd share.
